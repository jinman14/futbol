# Futbol

We met at a point for a mid-project retro and this is a short summary of it.

- We discussed work styles and figuring out the best way to proceed. We talked about the methods and the levels of difficulty, finding a new way to assign and complete the remaining methods. We also laughed and had some fun. When the retro concluded, we decided to go right to work on the project and found the actual flow and productivity was greatly enhanced. 

Final Retro Open
Participants: Sebastian, Jacob, Joe

What do we think went well?
- Everything went about as well as hoped. We got along well, and therefore it was easy to work well together. Finding times together was easy, we were all motivated and driven to succeed at this project, leading us to mostly finishing the actual coding four days early. This allowed us time to review, and debug as needed.

What needed improvement?
- As far as this project went, we would say the only real adjustment or issue was initial organization. Our initial work split was likely not ideal. Another thing would be that starting adjustment period to working with our different styles. Though, once figured out, it was no trouble anymore.

How were ideas and actions executed?
- After matching styles to the agreed upon form, the project flowed excellently. Ideas were heard, every member contributed through either their eye for debugging, or the structure and logic of the coding itself. Most was completed through driver/navigator.

Deliverables:
- Tools used: Github, Zoom, Slack.

- Top 3 that went well: Collaboration, Workflow (once going), Healthy work environment (it was lighted hearted and fun, while maintaining focus and productivity)

- Top 3 changes: More time outlining and plotting a course for our code structure, organization and distribution of the workload (mainly the parts and methods assigned), look into and implement one of the suggested group organizers.
